@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

8sync's goal is to make asynchronous programming easy.  If you've worked
with most other asynchronous programming environments, you know that it
generally isn't.  Usually asynchronous programming involves entering
some sort of ``callback hell''.  Some nicer environments like Asyncio
for Python provide generator-based coroutines, but even these require a
lot of work to carefully line up.

Coding in 8sync, on the other hand, looks almost entirely like coding
anywhere else.  This is because 8sync makes great use of a cool feature
in Guile called ``delimited continuations'' to power natural-feeling
coroutines.  Because of this, you can invoke your asynchronous code with
a small wrapper around it, and that code will pop off to complete
whatever other task it needs to do, and resume your function when it's
ready passing back the appropriate value.  (No need to manually chain
the coroutines together, and no callback hell at all!)

Now that's pretty cool!

@node Acknowledgements
@chapter Acknowledgements

8sync has a number of inspirations:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@uref{https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/asyncio.html, asyncio}
for Python provides a nice asynchronous programming environment, and
makes great use of generator-style coroutines.  It's a bit more
difficult to work with than 8sync (or so thinks the author) because you
have to ``line up'' the coroutines.

@item
@uref{http://dthompson.us/pages/software/sly.html, Sly}
by David Thompson is an awesome functional reactive game programming
library for Guile.  If you want to write graphical games, Sly is almost
certainly a better choice than 8sync.  Thanks to David for being very
patient in explaining tough concepts; experience on hacking Sly greatly
informed 8sync's development.  (Check out Sly, it rocks!)

@item
Reading @uref{https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/, SICP}, particularly
@uref{https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-19.html#%_chap_3,
      Chapter 3's writings on concurrent systems},
greatly informed 8sync's design.

@item
Finally, @uref{https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/asyncio.html, XUDD}
was an earlier ``research project'' that preceeded 8sync.  It attempted
to bring an actor model system to Python.  However, the author
eventually grew frustrated with some of Python's limitations, fell in
love with Guile, and well... now we have 8sync, which is much more
general anyway.

@end itemize

The motivation to build 8sync came out of
@uref{https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-devel/2015-10/msg00015.html, a conversation}
at the FSF 30th party between Mark Weaver, David Thompson, Andrew
Engelbrecht, and Christopher Allan Webber over how to build
an asynchronous event loop for Guile and just what would be needed.

A little over a month after that, hacking on 8sync began!
